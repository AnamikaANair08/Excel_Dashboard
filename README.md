# Global Trends and Insights (2000-2016) Dashboard:-
## Objective :-
It is designed to provide a comprehensive, data-driven perspective on global suicide trends (2000-2016), with an emphasis on identifying key patterns, gender disparities, and country-specific insights. It serves as a tool to raise awareness, support decision-making, and drive actionable solutions for suicide prevention.

## Key Insights :-
1. Global Gender Disparity:
Men are more prone to suicides globally, making gender-specific interventions crucial.
2. Regional Focus:
Eastern European countries consistently exhibit higher rates and need focused resources for prevention.
Low-suicide-rate countries could provide insights into best practices.
3. Positive Trends:
Overall declining rates in top countries (e.g., Russia) indicate that interventions might be effective, though improvements are gradual.
4. India-Specific Insights:
Stable rates suggest an opportunity for early intervention before rates escalate significantly.

This topic might be sensitive, but I chose to create this dashboard to bring clarity to the fact that depression, stress, and trauma are not gender-biased. Only those who experience these struggles truly understand how challenging life can become.
